                <h2>About the Problem</h2>
                <p>MapLab is Komodo Health's full-stack platform, designed to provide a comprehensive foundation for healthcare analytics. The U.S. healthcare system is fragmented, making it difficult for organizations to generate aggregate and provider-level insights. Komodo's Map cleans and processes this data, but a scalable software solution was needed to empower users with direct access to insights.</p>
                <p>As the Senior Product Manager, I led the development of MapLab, ensuring that both technical and non-technical users could leverage Komodo's healthcare data without extensive coding knowledge. This initiative resulted in a self-service analytics product that streamlined workflows, reduced time-to-insight, and generated over $XM in revenue within its first quarter.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>üìä Enable <strong>self-service analytics</strong> for users with varying levels of technical expertise</li>

                    <li>üöÄ Drive <strong>adoption and engagement</strong> through a user-friendly and scalable solution</li>

                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>‚öñÔ∏è <strong>Balancing Perfection with Agility</strong> ‚Äì Different teams have distinct priorities: Design seeks seamless aesthetics, QA demands zero defects, and Engineering wants scale. As a Product Manager, I want to solve customer problems without launching a feature that flops. With MapLab, we had to make tough calls, shifting tasks from launch to Post-MVP to ensure value delivery on time.</li>
                    <li>üîó <strong>Managing Dependencies Proactively</strong> ‚Äì Blockers were a major challenge during MapLab‚Äôs development. Some features were halted due to cross-team dependencies, impacting our velocity. We had to refine our products multiple times, ensuring no single team became a bottleneck for major development. Ensuring dependencies are considered when planning was vital.</li>
                    <li>‚è≥ <strong>Release Timelines Can Be a Moving Target</strong> ‚Äì Dates matter for GTM and Sales readiness, but rigid deadlines without feasibility checks can backfire. Even with those, the onion that software development is, can simply cause dates to shift to the right because of unknowns. While artificial deadlines can streamline operations and force scope cuts, they can also cause burnout and updated resumes if mismanaged.</li>
                    <li>üîÑ <strong>And Then What?</strong> ‚Äì We knew that getting access to the data was not enough. The initial launch of my product included only that and the BI tool for overlays. However, our customers needed customization of those datasets for this feature to truly sing. This helped us develop and reinforce our roadmap.</li>
