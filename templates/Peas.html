                <p>Launching a global event of this scale required extensive program management, coordination across multiple teams, and the ability to handle high traffic volumes while ensuring advertisers could seamlessly engage with the platform.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>üåé <strong>Launch a New Global Event</strong> ‚Äì Successfully managed the end-to-end rollout of Prime Early Access Sale across multiple countries</li>
                    <li>üõ† <strong>Ensure Quality</strong> ‚Äì Maintained the same level of quality for all advertising during this event as compared to Prime Day and Black Friday/Cyber Monday</li>
                    <li>üìä <strong>Enhance Operational Efficiency</strong> ‚Äì Streamlined processes for faster campaign deployment and real-time analytics given a short timeline for execution</li>

                            <td>Many of the buffer timelines that are normally added in were eliminated. We also had to diligently track our working backwards document to identify drop-dead dates for deliverables.

                            <td>Prime Day and Black Friday/Cyber Monday had been events for a number of years with historical data available. This event had less confidence in forecasting due to its inaugural nature so scenario based modeling was utilized to capture worst and best case site traffic that was utilized in pricing</td>

                            <td>We were also preparing for Black Friday at this same time so there were competing priorities and limited resources available. A few approaches were used to manage this: 1 - any consolidated efforts for advertisers in both events were made; 2 - priority and more flexibility was given to advertisers that secured deals early on; and 3 - many materials and policies were reused from Prime Day that made implementation easier</td>

                <h2>Failures & Lessons Learned</h2>
                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>‚öñÔ∏è <strong>Importance of Working Backwards</strong> ‚Äì The working backwards methodology was extremely helpful in setting clear delivery deadlines and what the impact of missing deadlines would be. This is often referred to as the Critical Path in Project Management but until one sees it utilized, both properly and improperly, the value of it does not sync in in it's entirety</li>
                
                    <li>üîó <strong>Upward Communication and Expectation Management</strong> ‚Äì Due to competing priorities (Black Friday and Cyber Monday), resourcing and sticking to a timeline was difficult. I learned the importance of structured check-ins with senior stakeholders to improve executive buy-in and secure necessary resources early on to prevent future issues</li>
                
                    <li>‚è≥ <strong>Importance of Cross-Functional Status Updates</strong> ‚Äì The need for constant coordination across engineering, marketing, and sales meant that delays in one area had a cascading effect. I learned the importance of cross-functional communications and the need for update cadences‚Äîsuch as daily standups or enhanced project tracking‚Äîto minimize misalignment and improve overall execution efficiency</li>
