                    "Dr. Nielson has been the only teacher throughout my online undergrad and graduate journey to ever upload video instruction weekly. This action helped me tremendously in this course! He is very responsive to emails and provides quality feedback that is constructive and engaging. Please do what you can to keep this guy; he is amazing."

                    "The thoughtful feedback provided by our professor throughout this course was incredibly helpful in improving my work and understanding of the material. The mini-lectures he gave were a highlight as well as they provided clear explanations and made even the more complex topics easier to grasp. Overall, the course was well-structured, and the support and guidance from my professor made a big difference in my learning experience."

                    "I have had the pleasure of being a student in professor Nielson's class, and I can confidently say they are an outstanding professor. Their knowledge and passion for the subject are evident in every lecture. This is the first course in my MBA program that a professor has posted an actual video of a lecture, which is so appreciated. Professor Nielson has a unique ability to make complex concepts accessible and engaging. I highly recommend their courses to any student looking to gain a deep understanding of the subject while feeling truly supported in their academic journey! Thank you Professor Nielson!"

                    "I really have enjoyed this class. Professor Nielson posts recordings at the beginning of the week to supplement lectures. I appreciated this approach and found it more engaging than the written lecture approach that most other professors use. I also feel that the assignments challenged me to apply the knowledge being taught for the week to current real-world problems. It was a really good class that was facilitated very well."
