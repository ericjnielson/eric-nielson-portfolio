                <h2>About the Problem</h2>
                <p>Scaling a product while maintaining targeting accuracy and reducing operational complexity is a significant challenge. As LiveConnect expanded, ensuring seamless ad delivery across platforms, improving video targeting capabilities, and training internal teams became key priorities.</p>

                <ul class="styled-list">
                    <li>üìà <strong>Scaling the Product</strong> ‚Äì Expanded LiveConnect‚Äôs reach to additional networks and advertisers while ensuring optimal performance.</li>

                    <li>üéØ <strong>Launching Video Targeting</strong> ‚Äì Developed advanced video ad personalization based on real-time game updates.</li>
                    <li>üéì <strong>Training Internal Teams</strong> ‚Äì Provided comprehensive onboarding and knowledge-sharing sessions to enhance adoption.</li>

                            <td>This challenge had a root cause of having too many edge cases. I created a number of case studies based on previous campaigns that led to the creation of Product tiers.

                            <td>A combination of reducing complexity through product tiers was developed that cut down ~50% of campaign development to 30 mins. I then identified 5 friction points in campaign creation for the more complex projects to streamline down to 1 - 3 days</td>

                    <li>‚öñÔ∏è <strong>Not Asking For Help</strong> ‚Äì I joined the team and was expected to manage the product and set up Liveconnect campaigns in roughly 4 weeks before college football season. I did not ask for help earlier and often enough and led to a number of preventable errors in the first campaign</li>
                    <li>üîó <strong>Lack of Vision</strong> ‚Äì I had not realized the value of what a coherent vision could create as I got into product management and did not have one for Liveconnect. This vision helps to inspire, mobilize and create standard mental models for teams to develop against</li>
                    <li>‚è≥ <strong>Confusing Features with Value</strong> ‚Äì I initially believed that simply launching a feature would immediately bring value to customers, however, I failed to understand that the value must come in that feature solving a specific customer problem or use case</li>
